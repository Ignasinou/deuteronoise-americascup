## About the Project

**DeuteroNoise** is a JPI Oceans project (*NoiseInTheSea-2022-0011*) studying maritime noise across multiple European basins — the Catalan coast, the Venice Lagoon, and the western Black Sea.

This Barcelona case study focuses on the **37th America’s Cup**, offering the **first quantified assessment of event-related underwater noise** in an urban coastal environment.

The project is conducted by the **Human–Environment Research (HER)** group at *La Salle – Universitat Ramon Llull* (Spain).

### Objectives

- Quantify broadband and band-limited sound pressure level (SPL) variations during the event.  
- Compare event vs non-event acoustic conditions.  
- Provide open, calibrated data through the DeuteroNoise Dataset.
