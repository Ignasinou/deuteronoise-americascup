## About the Project

**DeuteroNoise** is a JPI Oceans project (*NoiseInTheSea-2022-0011*) investigating underwater noise across multiple European basins, including the Catalan coast, North sea in Norway, the Venice Lagoon, and the western Black Sea.  
Its overarching goal is to quantify, compare, and openly share data on anthropogenic acoustic pressure in coastal and shelf environments.

This **Barcelona case study** focuses on the **37th America’s Cup**, providing the **first quantified assessment of event-related underwater noise in European waters**.  
The previous 36th America’s Cup in New Zealand (Pine *et al.*, 2024) offered the first global evidence of regatta-induced acoustic impacts.  
Our study extends this work to a densely populated **urban Mediterranean context**, highlighting the cumulative influence of spectator and support-vessel traffic within an already active port environment.

The project is led by the **Human–Environment Research (HER)** group at *La Salle – Universitat Ramon Llull* (Barcelona, Spain).
