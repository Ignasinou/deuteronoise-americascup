## About the Project

**DeuteroNoise** is a JPI Oceans project (*NoiseInTheSea-2022-0011*) investigating maritime noise across multiple European basins — the Catalan coast, the Venice Lagoon, and the western Black Sea.

This **Barcelona case study** focuses on the **37th America’s Cup**, representing the **first quantified assessment of event-related underwater noise in Europe**.  
The earlier 36th America’s Cup in New Zealand (Pine et al., 2024) provided the first global evidence of regatta-induced acoustic impacts.  
Our study extends that work to a densely populated **urban Mediterranean context**, offering new insights into the cumulative pressure of spectator and support vessel traffic in a European coastal environment.

The project is conducted by the **Human–Environment Research (HER)** group at *La Salle – Universitat Ramon Llull* (Spain).

### Objectives

- Quantify broadband and band-limited sound pressure level (SPL) variations during the 37th America’s Cup.  
- Compare event vs. non-event acoustic conditions in an urban coastal site.  
- Provide open, calibrated acoustic data through the [DeuteroNoise Dataset](https://github.com/Ignasinou/deuteronoise-dataset-preview).
