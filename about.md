# About the Project

**DeuteroNoise** is a JPI Oceans project (NoiseInTheSea-2022-0011) that studies maritime noise in multiple European basins (Catalan coast, Venice Lagoon, Black Sea).

This subproject focuses on the **Barcelona case study**, coinciding with the **37th Americaâ€™s Cup (2024)**. It represents the **first quantified assessment** of underwater acoustic pollution during a major international sailing event.
