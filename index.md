Welcome to the **DeuteroNoise – America's Cup Soundscapes** project.

This initiative quantifies the **underwater acoustic footprint** of the  
**37th America’s Cup (Barcelona, 2024)** using calibrated hydrophone recordings  
and time-synchronised AIS data from the [**DeuteroNoise Dataset**](https://github.com/Ignasinou/deuteronoise-dataset-preview).

During October 2024, broadband SPLs rose by **up to 20 dB re 1 µPa rms**,  
and natural day–night cycles flattened due to sustained vessel activity  
from support fleets and spectator boats.
