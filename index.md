Welcome to the **DeuteroNoise – America's Cup Soundscapes** project.

This initiative quantifies the **underwater acoustic footprint** of the  
**37th America’s Cup (Barcelona, 2024)** using calibrated hydrophone recordings  
and time-synchronised AIS vessel data from the  
[**DeuteroNoise Dataset**](https://github.com/Ignasinou/deuteronoise-dataset-preview).

## AIS Vessel Tracks — Final Race (19 October 2024, 14:00–16:00 UTC)

    <strong>Figure 1.</strong> Automatic Identification System (AIS) vessel passages recorded near Port Vell (Barcelona) during the final race of the 37th America’s Cup (19 October 2024, 14:00–16:00 UTC).  
    Each coloured trajectory represents a unique vessel track derived from the DeuteroNoise-synchronised AIS dataset.

During the final race weekend, **broadband sound pressure levels (20 Hz–20 kHz)** at the Espai Vela site increased by approximately **5–8 dB re 1 µPa rms** compared with baseline conditions.  
The natural day–night contrast observed earlier in July (about 5 dB difference) nearly disappeared, reflecting continuous vessel activity from support, security, and spectator fleets operating throughout the event.
