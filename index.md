Welcome to the **DeuteroNoise – America's Cup Soundscapes** project.

This initiative quantifies the **underwater acoustic footprint** of the  
**37th America’s Cup (Barcelona, 2024)** using calibrated hydrophone recordings  
and time-synchronised AIS data from the [**DeuteroNoise Dataset**](https://github.com/Ignasinou/deuteronoise-dataset-preview).

    <strong>Figure 1.</strong> Automatic Identification System (AIS) vessel passages recorded near Port Vell (Barcelona) during the final race of the 37th America’s Cup (19 October 2024, 14:00–16:00 UTC).  
    Each coloured trajectory represents a unique vessel track derived from the DeuteroNoise-synchronised AIS dataset.

During the final race weekend, broadband SPLs rose by **up to 20 dB re 1 µPa rms**,  
and natural day–night cycles flattened due to sustained vessel activity  
from support fleets and spectator boats.
